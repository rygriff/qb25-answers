This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
header <- c("chr", "start", "end", "count")
df_hg19kc <- read_tsv('/Users/cmdb/qb25-answers/week1/hg19-kc-count.bed', col_names = header)
df_hg16kc <- read_tsv('/Users/cmdb/qb25-answers/week1/hg16-kc-count.bed', col_names = header)
df_hg19and16 <- bind_rows(hg19 = df_hg19kc, hg16 = df_hg16kc, .id = "assembly")
df_hg19and16
```
```{r}
ggplot(df_hg19and16, aes(x = start, y = count, color = assembly)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = df_hg19and16 %>% filter(str_starts(chr, "chrM"))) +
  facet_wrap(~ chr, scales = "free_x") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "hg19 vs hg16"
  )
 ggsave("exercise2.png", width = 18)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
